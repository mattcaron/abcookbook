'abcookbook' is a package for entering recipes in a style inspired by
Alton Brown's cookbooks. The notable difference between this style and
a more conventional style is that Mr. Brown refers to ingredients as
"Software", and adds another section called "Hardware", describing any
equipment necessary. In this version, I've retained a more
conventional "Ingredints" and "Equipment" nomenclature, but still
added the extra "Equipment" section. After all, if you're making
something which needs a 9" pie pan, you'd like to know before
starting. I've also tweaked the color scheme a bit to work well on
monochrome printers.

This package is based on 'xcookybooky' by Sven Harder, which is, in
turn, based on the 'cookybooky' package by Jürgen Gilg.  Unfortunately
it uses some special packages and fonts. Another handicap is the
missing possibility to create a PDF directly. This limitations are
reversed.

As a result of the changes not all options known from 'cookybooky' are
implemented in this package.  But nevertheless it provides some new
options, e.g.  an improved color and fontsize management and more
recipe fields.


Usage
----------------------------------
The recipes are inserted in a environment. There is the possibility to
enter ingredients, preparation (steps), (two) pictures and a
hint. Also there is an option to insert the recipe time, baking time,
portions, calorie content and source of the recipe (internet, friends,
neighbors etc.).

Package contents
----------------------------------
The current distribution includes the following files
    'abcookbook.ins',
    'abcookbook.dtx',
    'abcookbook.pdf',
    'README'.
Also there is a folder including an example, which
helps you (hopefully) to understand the usage of this
package.
